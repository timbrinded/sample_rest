# Sample REST Server with CRUD 

## Description
This is a sample node.js REST server built using TDD on Jest. 
Using this you can very simply connect to a database and perform basic CRUD operations.

## Instructions
1. Create or acquire a DB connection string. I used a free account created here [mongo db](https://www.mongodb.com/atlas-signup-from-mlab)
2. Create a `.env` file containing your DB connection string. You can refer to `.env.example` for reference.
3. Run `npm install`

### To run as a server:
```
node server.js
```

### To run the tests:
```
npm run test
```
